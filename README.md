# Database Management System
![Database](https://greencloudvps.com/greencloudvps/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/database-management-system-3-750x422.jpg)

## Introduction

This is a database management system built with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html) that includes two user access levels: Admin and Employee. Employees can add, remove, and reduce stock items, track transactions, view database contents, and place orders. Admin users can manage user accounts. This program provides a fundamental model for learning stock management, application development, and simple SQL syntax.

## Updates
> v1.0.0 - First release of software. 

## Installation
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/KashiCode/SimpleDBMS.git
- Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) are installed on your system. 
- Run Directory.py (To check your python directory location and ensure it is on path).
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run config.py (if database files are not included).
- Run launch.bat 


## Dependencies
- Python 3
> This project requires Python 3.6 or later.
- PyQt5
> This project requires PyQt5 5.15.0 or later.
- sqlite3
> This project requires sqlite3 3.39.4 or later. 

## Usage

- Default admin credentials: 
> Username: Admin

> Password: 1234

- Default employee credentials
> Username: Employee

> Password: 1234

- To create your own credentials edit the c.execute statement:

```python
# Code to create your own login if the database does not feature the default credentials.
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("users.db")
c = conn.cursor()

# Where username is your username, password is your password and role is either "employee" or "admin".
c.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES ('username', 'password', 'role')")
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()


```
