![Database](https://greencloudvps.com/greencloudvps/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/database-management-system-3-750x422.jpg)

## Introduction

This is a database management system built with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html) that includes two user access levels: Admin and Employee. Employees can add, remove, and reduce stock items, track transactions, view database contents, and place orders. Admin users can manage user accounts. This program provides a fundamental model for learning stock management, application development, and simple SQL syntax.
